This page uses a dataset downloaded July 19, 2021. At the time of download, there were 53 columns and 1,232,097 rows. Despite the large number of records, only a handful are relevant to this paper. This is because the dataset contains all requests to 311, not just those related to code enforcement. Additionally, many columns contain duplicate or unhelpful information. For instance, there are 23 columns related to location and under the column LAST_UPDATED_BY, every single entry was the number “460101.” The dataset was simplified by filtering for code enforcement data and narrowing the number of columns. CE &lt;- Service_Requests_since_2016 %&gt;% filter(DEPARTMENT == &quot;Code Enforcement&quot;) %&gt;% select( INCIDENT_NUMBER, #&#39; unique key; service request (sr) number PARCEL_ID, #&#39; parcel ID ADDRESS1, #&#39; just the street name &amp; number (alt: use FULL_ADDRESS) REQUEST_TYPE, #&#39; category for the request CE_CATEGORY, #&#39; category for CE action RESOLUTION_CODE:RESOLUTION_SUMMARY, #&#39; categorizes &amp; explains how the request resolved REQUEST_STATUS, #&#39; is the request open or closed? REPORTED_DATE, #&#39; date the request was reported LAST_MODIFIED_DATE, #&#39; date the request was last modified OWNER_NAME, #&#39; the assigned CE inspector location1 #&#39; geocoordinates ) The output is 13 columns and 154,844 rows, significantly easier to work with. We’re ready to begin looking at the data. 4.2 Requests by Year First, how many requests were created each year? We can filter the REPORTED_DATE column to find out. CE16 &lt;- CE %&gt;% filter(REPORTED_DATE &gt;= \"2016-01-01\", REPORTED_DATE &lt; \"2017-01-01\") Below are the number of requests for each year between 2016 and 2021. Reported Date Number of Requests 2016 30,361 2017 26,196 2018 26,846 2019 27,559 2020 26,194 2021 (as of 07/19/2021) 17,688 The number of requests has not changed much over the years. 4.2.1 Active Cases How many cases are still active from each year? We can find out using the REQUEST_STATUS column, filtering out cases marked “Closed” or \"Resolved. CE16 %&gt;% filter(!str_detect(REQUEST_STATUS, \"Closed|Resolved\")) Year Active Cases 2016 136 2017 111 2018 532 2019 956 2020 1,098 2021 5,630 All Years 8,463 4.3 Request Type When a request is entered into 311, it must also be categorized. There are 14 categories for code enforcement data, including 3 categories related to COVID violations which were added in 2020. The following code was used to find the most common requests for each year: CE16 %&gt;% count(REQUEST_TYPE) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% mutate(pct = n/sum(n)*100) For each year, the vast majority of requests fell into one of five categories, listed below. Request Type 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 All Years Code Miscellaneous 28% 32% 32% 31% 25% 25% 45,028 29% Vehicle Violation 22% 26% 28% 26% 30% 35% 42,249 27% Weeds Occupied 20% 18% 17% 19% 14% 11% 26,161 17% Junky Yard 18% 13% 11% 12% 12% 15% 21,283 14% Substandard, Derelict Structure 9% 8% 10% 10% 7% 9% 13,778 9% Sum 97% 97% 98% 98% 88% 95% 148,499 96% From 2016 to 2019, more requests were sorted into “Miscellaneous” than any other category (surpassed by vehicle violations in 2020 and 2021). 4.4 Resolution Code "]]
