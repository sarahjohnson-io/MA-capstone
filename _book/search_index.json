[["literature.html", "Chapter 2 Literature 2.1 Housing and Health 2.2 Code Enforcement", " Chapter 2 Literature Here is a review of existing methods. 2.1 Housing and Health The link between housing and health is extensive and well documented. Occupants of a home are exposed to biologic, chemical, and physical agents that can affect their health and safety (CDC and HUD 2006, 63) . For instance, paint containing lead is known to cause childhood lead poisoning, which lead to the a ban on lead-based paint for residential use in 1978 (CDC 2020). Asthma, a respiratory disease which causes episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, has been linked to exposure to mold or dampness and pests including dust mites, cockroaches, and rodents (CDC and HUD 2006, 63). Reviewing the existing literature, Mendell et al. (2011) found dampness inside homes was linked to a wide range of respiratory or allergic health effects, including asthma. The authors concluded that prevention and remediation to reduce indoor dampness is urgently needed in a large proportion of the building stock, and such measures could significantly reduce the prevalence of respiratory and allergic disease. Rauh, Chew, and Garfinkel (2002) found that cockroach allergen levels are related to the degree of household disrepair, and similarly suggested that public health interventions in housing could reduce allergen exposure. In 2015, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America named Memphis the asthma capital of America (Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America 2015), based on prevalence, risk factors, and medical factors. Recent efforts to reduce the prevalence and risk of asthma have been successful—Memphis’s rank has since decreased to 41st in 2021 (Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America 2021).1 However, Memphis still ranks high in asthma-related mortality, placing 7th of 100 cities. A study in Memphis comparing pediatric asthma data with property quality information found that asthma prevalence is disproportionately distributed throughout the city (Shin and Shaban-Nejad 2018). Neighborhood blight and inequality were closely associated with childhood asthma and other health problems, leading authors to conclude that effective health interventions should consider involving housing policies and procedures. Households can take certain steps to reduce health risks, such as decreasing allergens by removing pets from the home and frequent dusting and vacuuming. However, risks caused by larger structural issues can be difficult to implement, particularly for low-income households that rent, as tenants have little or no power to repair such problems. A study of low-income parents of children with asthma found landlords were directly involved in keeping homes in poor condition, even when asked by the tenant to fix the property (Grineski and Hernández 2010). Relocating families can reduce health risks, but higher rents associated with safer housing can make it financially difficult or impossible for some families to move (McLaine et al. 2006). 2.2 Code Enforcement The earliest known housing codes date back to the Code of Hammurabi, written in stone c. 1750 BC (“The Code of Hammurabi,” n.d. codes 228-233). The text, known for it’s “eye for an eye” policies, holds builders directly responsible for the homes they build—meaning if a building was not constructed properly and it fell and killed its owner, the builder would be put to death. Over the past twenty years, there have been at least two expansive reports offering critiques and criticisms of Memphis’s code enforcement. While each report aimed to improve code enforcement, the reasoning differed—one sought to address crime and safety, the other public health. Both reports also included at least one contributor from the University of Memphis’s City and Regional Planning Department. References "]]
