This website contains the final capstone that was required to complete my master's degree. You can read it online here: <https://sj-io.github.io/MA-capstone/>. It was submitted August 6, 2021 and as of September 20 I am returning to update and correct/improve some sections.

To view the code and comments behind the website, first have R and RStudio installed on your computer. Click the green "Code" button on this website's Github [repository](https://github.com/sj-io/MA-capstone) and download the ZIP. Unzip, then open the MA-capstone.Rproj file.

The `.Rmd` files are where all the text and code I wrote are contained. A file beginning with an underscore is hidden on the website (usually a first draft or scratch page that may be removed later).
