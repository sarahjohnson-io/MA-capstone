These manuals prioritized newly built suburban neighborhoods, discouraging banks from making any loans in urban areas. They contained explicitly racist language, calling for lower ratings in neighborhoods with “inharmonious racial groups” (Federal Housing Administration 1938, secs. 935, 937, 951, and 982). This language was dropped in 1947, though the manual continued to value properties based on “compatibility among the neighborhood occupants” (Rothstein 2017, 66, citing the 1952 Manual). Color-coded maps were created for cities across the U.S. to illustrate mortgage ratings. Neighborhoods deemed the riskiest were shaded red, leading to the term “redlining.” Memphis was no exception; below is a mortgage rating map from the 1930s. A color-coded map of Memphis created in the 1930s used by the federal government to rate mortgage risk. Original source: National Archives and Records Administration, accessed via (Bradley 2019). Below is a digitized version of the above map.1 Overall, 69% of the city was deemed “hazardous” (red) or “definitely declining” (yellow), notably containing all of Downtown and the majority of North and South Memphis. Only 7% of the city received an A rating (“best,” green), including the Central Gardens neighborhood, areas adjacent to Overton Park, Chickasaw Gardens, and East Memphis neighborhoods adjacent to golf courses. The remaining 24% of the city (“still desirable,” blue) contains other Midtown neighborhoods and follows the Poplar Avenue corridor to the east.2 Railroads and large streets were typically the dividing line between positive and negative ratings. In recent years, at least three major lawsuits have been settled concerning discriminatory lending in Memphis (Bradley 2019; Uhlmann 2020). Excessive foreclosures following the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis led Memphis and Shelby County to file suit against Wells Fargo for targeting Black neighborhoods for predatory lending practices, which the bank settled for $425 million in 2012 (Rothacker 2012). Following the Great Recession, banks became selective of whom they targeted and approved for mortgages, often at the expensive of non-white residents. In 2016, BancorpSouth and First Tennessee Bank settled separate suits for $10.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, against accusations of disproportionately denying loan applications to non-white borrowers and failing to build branches in non-white neighborhoods Lane (2016a). 3.2 Health In 2015, Memphis was named the asthma capital of America by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA 2015), based on prevalence, risk factors, and medical factors. Recent efforts to reduce the prevalence and risk of asthma have been successful—Memphis’s rank has since decreased to 41st in 2021 (AAFA 2021).3 However, Memphis still ranks high in asthma-related mortality, placing 7th of 100 cities. A recent study comparing pediatric asthma data with property quality information found that asthma prevalence is disproportionately distributed throughout Memphis (Shin and Shaban-Nejad 2018). Neighborhood blight and inequality were closely associated with childhood asthma and other health problems, leading authors to conclude that effective health interventions should consider involving housing policies and procedures.
