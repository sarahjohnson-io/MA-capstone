<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Known Links</h2>
<p>The link between housing and health is extensive and well documented. Occupants of a home are exposed to biologic, chemical, and physical agents that can affect their health and safety <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cdc2006" role="doc-biblioref">CDC and HUD 2006, 63</a>)</span>. For instance, paint containing lead is known to cause childhood lead poisoning, which lead to the a ban on lead-based paint for residential use in 1978 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cdc2020" role="doc-biblioref">CDC 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="respiratory-health" class="section level3" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Respiratory Health</h3>
<p>Asthma, a respiratory disease which causes episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, has been linked to exposure to mold or dampness and pests including dust mites, cockroaches, and rodents <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cdc2006" role="doc-biblioref">CDC and HUD 2006, 63</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Reviewing the existing literature, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mendell2011" role="doc-biblioref">Mendell et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-mendell2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> found dampness inside homes was linked to a wide range of respiratory or allergic health effects, including asthma. The authors concluded that prevention and remediation to reduce indoor dampness is urgently needed in a large proportion of the building stock, and such measures could significantly reduce the prevalence of respiratory and allergic disease. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-rauh2002" role="doc-biblioref">Rauh, Chew, and Garfinkel</a> (<a href="#ref-rauh2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> found that cockroach allergen levels are related to the degree of household disrepair, and similarly suggested that public health interventions in housing could reduce allergen exposure.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Healthy Homes</h2>
<p>Recognizing that “health, home construction, and home maintenance are inseparable because of their overlapping goals,” HUD and CDC joined together in 1999 to launch the Healthy Homes Initiative <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cdc2006" role="doc-biblioref">CDC and HUD 2006, 31, 34</a>)</span>. Many of the basic principles were originally laid out in 1938 by a Committee on the Hygiene of Housing, who provided guidance on the fundamental needs of humans as they relate to housing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cdc2006" role="doc-biblioref">CDC and HUD 2006, 39</a>; <a href="#ref-apha1938" role="doc-biblioref">APHA 1938</a>)</span>. The fundamental needs were originally divided into four categories: physiological needs (e.g. protection from elements), psychological needs (e.g. adequate privacy), protection against contagion (e.g. safe water supply), and protection against accidents (e.g. fire prevention).</p>
<p>The modern Healthy Home Rating System (HHRS) is a list of 29 hazards, categorized in accordance with these needs <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-HHRSover" role="doc-biblioref">HUD, n.d.a, 2</a>)</span>. The below table lists all the hazards, along with a short description and which populations are most vulnerable to the specific hazard (adopted from <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-HHRSlst" role="doc-biblioref">HUD</a> (<a href="#ref-HHRSlst" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.b</a>)</span>).</p>

<p>The HHRS provides a standardized way to identify and rate the risk of home health hazards. Once a hazard is identified, it is further rated according to severity and the effect it is having, or could have, on the occupants. The greater the risk or more serious the outcome, the higher the overall score. The system provides a way to compare risks associated with different types of hazards.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-HHRSover" role="doc-biblioref">HUD</a> (<a href="#ref-HHRSover" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.a</a>)</span>, this system allows local housing and health departments to know which hazards are most serious to the occupants, allowing them to prioritize funding. It also lets local policy makers identify which areas of the community are in greatest need and what health impacts those communities are facing.</p>
<!--# Households can take certain steps to reduce health risks, such as decreasing allergens by removing pets from the home and frequent dusting and vacuuming.  -->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Maintenance in the Private Rental Market</h2>
<p>Health risks caused by larger structural issues can be difficult to implement, particularly for low-income households that rent, as tenants have little or no power to repair such problems. A study of low-income parents of children with asthma found landlords were directly involved in keeping homes in poor condition, even when asked by the tenant to fix the property, and a cycle of fear, poverty, and lack of power compounded to make tenants hesitant to report problems <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grineski2010" role="doc-biblioref">Grineski and Hernández 2010</a>)</span>. Relocating families can reduce health risks, but higher rents associated with safer housing can make it financially difficult or impossible for some families to move <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mclaine2006" role="doc-biblioref">McLaine et al. 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Current regulation of private rental housing quality assumes that tenants will take action to report substandard housing, yet this is often not the case. To understand the disconnect between the law’s expectations and reality, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-chisholm2018" role="doc-biblioref">Chisholm, Howden-Chapman, and Fougere</a> (<a href="#ref-chisholm2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> collected existing qualitative literature to explore power dynamics in the landlord-tenant relationship. The research showed that, for the most part, tenants who “reported housing quality problems found it a stressful experience, with repairs taking a long time to be carried out, or not at all.” This experience often impacted future behavior, causing tenants to avoid reporting problems because they did not think it would be effective.</p>
<p>In some cases, tenants would rather move out than work towards a resolution, leaving the issue open for future tenants. In other instances, tenants with low incomes were aware of the lack of alternative housing, causing them to remain silent. Fear of eviction prevented tenants from reporting problems, and this fear was not unfounded; in three of the 15 studies, tenants who reported housing problems were evicted or forced to move. Though laws against retaliatory action might exist, no-cause evictions allow landlords to still remove the tenant from the unit. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-chisholm2018" role="doc-biblioref">Chisholm, Howden-Chapman, and Fougere</a> (<a href="#ref-chisholm2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> concludes that tenants do not report housing quality problems because the regulation that relies on their reporting fails to protect many tenants.</p>
<p>A wide range of solutions are put forward to improve tenant reporting. Ending no-cause evictions and expanding legal aid can encourage tenants who may have been scared to speak up. Increasing the supply of social or public housing can expand housing options to households most vulnerable to changes in rent. The authors also suggest authorities supervise a web-based reporting system for repair requests, establishing clear records, automated reminders to the landlords, and an opportunity for authorities to step in for unduly slow repairs.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper seeks to understand the quality of private rental housing in Memphis and systems to report maintenance problems, particularly in cases of landlord neglect.</p>
