# Summary

The link between housing and health has been well established. Modern humans spend a majority of their time indoors, and the condition of their surroundings inevitably impacts their health. Protecting the public health and safety was the first instance of government involvement of housing. Building standards and health codes have long been established to regulate housing conditions. While the quality of new housing has improved overtime, oft overlooked is the quality of existing homes and whether homes are being maintained.

This paper highlights the role of tenure in maintenance neglect and enforcement. If a homeowner requires housing maintenance, they are able to directly contract and hire someone to repair the problem; for financially strapped individuals, a wide range of subsidies and grants exist geared towards home repair, upgrades, and weatherization. If a tenant experiences a maintenance problem, ensuring repairs are completed is out of their control. They are entirely reliant upon the landlord to follow through with repairs.

When a landlord receives rent, the rent is divided between expenditures in the home and profit for themselves. Tenants have no control over how their rent is portioned, it is for the landlord to decide. Tenants in low-rent homes can be particularly at risk; their homes are likely older and require more maintenance, and lower rents means lower profit margins, incentivizing low-rent landlords to neglect maintenance to preserve profits. Unless a landlord lives on the property, tenants are the ones burdened with experiencing the effects of the neglect, while the landlord is able to ignore and forget the problem while continuing to receive an income.

Tenants who persistently remind the landlord of the problem risk damaging their relationship with their landlord, rent increases, or a forced move due to the landlord choosing to sell the property, the extent of the problem requiring the tenant move for repairs to be completed, or eviction as retaliation. Tenants who withhold rent in an attempt to force their landlords to complete repairs are also at risk of eviction. If a landlord opts to ignore a problem, tenants are left in a powerless position with an impossible choice: speak up and risk their housing stability or stay silent and suffer the health consequences of the problem.

Tenants experiencing neglect are incentivized to move to a home with a more responsible owner, or to purchase a home and exit the rental market altogether. This, for one, leaves the problem open for future tenants of the home. But increasingly there is not an option for a home that is available, affordable, and in better condition. If a home is affordable and in better condition, the demand will be high and it likely won't be available. If a home is available and in better condition, it is likely more expensive. If a home is available and affordable, the tenant will likely run into the same maintenance issues as their previous home.

The number of people experiencing this dilemma has increased, particularly over the past decade. As a fallout of the Great Recession, many homeowners became renters and homes formerly occupied by owners were converted into rentals. As rent increases have outpaced incomes over the past decade, renters are more likely to be cost burdened than owners, and rents increasingly eat into their ability to save for a down payment. Households can become trapped in rentership, whether they want to rent or not. As the option of homeownership slips away and cost burdenship rises, more renters fall vulnerable to the power dynamics of the rental market.

<!--# Consider two neighbors, Jane and Catherine, both homeowners experiencing the Great Recession. Catherine loses her job during the recession and is no longer able to pay her mortgage. She is forced to sell the home, and the only bids are from out of state investors looking to convert the home into a rental. Feeling she has no other choice, Catherine sells the home, but she is able to stay as a renter. Meanwhile, Jane does not lose her job or her home. Over the next decade, property taxes remain flat but rents rise, far outpacing any gains Catherine sees in income. By 2021, Catherine is paying more for housing than Jane, and she has lost control over how her housing money is spent.-->
