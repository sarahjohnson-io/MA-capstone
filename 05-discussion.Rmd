# Discussion

Code enforcement is the only recourse for renters who want to report landlord neglect. However, Memphis code enforcement does not categorize or track this data. Instead, this information is shuffled into a miscellaneous category, with duplicates and errors. While the dataset may be updated daily, it is incredibly hard to organize, and the volume of cases added daily only made the job more difficult.

In conversations with other housing researchers, I found I was not alone in my frustrations with this dataset. I have yet to meet someone who established a way to sort through all the data. One researcher who did regularly use the data did so by limiting the scope/analysis to individual neighborhoods.

This leads me to believe that Memphis code enforcement does not regularly sort through existing data to find trends and patterns. This would not be surprising, except for the department having two lengthy reports over 20 years calling for a strategic, rather than a reactive, code enforcement. A strategic code enforcement requires regular analysis of existing data, to find trends and identify blind spots. Without a strategy, code enforcement will opt for the reactive system. This leads inspectors to spend a disproportionate amount of time on minor violations instead of ones that impact public health. As stated by @betts2001, "individual efforts, no matter how well intentioned, are by definition *not strategic*." [44]

Attempting to organize this dataset reminded me of Matthew Desmond discussing the difficulty in finding accurate eviction data for any city just a decade ago. The data existed but it was unorganized and messy. He established the Eviction Lab to draw attention to the problem and help other people access the data. Making the data widely available allowed it to be studied and discussed. The extent of the eviction crisis became apparent, and soon evictions became one of the most important topics in housing.

Public housing in America ended due to mismanagement and neglect of maintenance, and yet few people are calling for the end of private rental housing due to the same practices. Perhaps part of the reason public housing ended was the relative ease of monitoring and tracking the neglect. Information on public housing is publicly available; with relative ease I can find a list of what properties are managed by the city, view the agency plan and yearly financial audit which breaks down revenues and expenses. Meanwhile, trying to find such information about the private rental market is nearly impossible. How are we to hold the private rental market accountable if we don't know the extent of the problem?

## Recommendations

While I recognize that asking an organization to alter its data entry methods is a big ask, I have a few specific recommendations which I believe could completely alter the nature of 311 data.

1.  Create a new `REQUEST_TYPE` for requests related to private rental/landlord neglect. This would replace at least some of the "Code Miscellaneous" category with more substantive information. It might also encourage more tenant reporting, as tenants know they're placing their complaint with the right agency.
2.  Create a `RESOLUTION_CODE` for duplicates, replacing "JA" and similar. (For instance "DUPE" is used by other cities like [Cincinnati](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Thriving-Neighborhoods/Code-Enforcement/cncm-znd6))
3.  Do not put all information for one case on one row, overwriting old data. Instead, allow each update its own row.
4.  Close out old cases which are clearly no open anymore.
5.  Implement the **HHRS** into the data system. For occupied housing units, categorize hazards using the HHRS.
