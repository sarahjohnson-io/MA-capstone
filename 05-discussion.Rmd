# Discussion

Despite code enforcement being the only recourse for renters experiencing landlord neglect, code enforcement does not categorize or track this data. Instead, it is shuffled into a miscellaneous category with duplicates and errors. How can so much data say so little? How are we supposed to create a strategic code enforcement if it is difficult to understand the data we already have?

I do not feel comfortable plotting this data because of the large number of errors, particularly with hard-to-sort duplicates, and incorrect addresses. It is too easy to misrepresent this data. I do not feel comfortable summarizing this data and drawing conclusions. A map can hide the problem; viewers cannot read all the error messages behind the data. [I'll try to clean this data as much as possible the next few days

Instead we should stop, process what we have, find common problems and patterns, and implement improvements. We should be conscious of specific problems faced in the private rental market.

We should do this because our code enforcement's largest hurdle is [the **same problem** it faced twenty years ago]{.ul}. Memphis still lacks the ability to efficiently monitor properties and "analyze overall patterns, and hold inspectors accountable for outcomes. At the root of the problem is an outdated computer and data management system. Enforcement decisions remain at the level of individual inspectors: the effectiveness of individual decisions are largely invisible in the absence of systematic analysis and evaluation. Individual inspectors may have sufficient knowledge to understand what is going on with particular properties, and may have an experiential grasp of patterns of property ownership that enables them to know who among property owners is least responsible, for example. If they are hard working and retain a belief that their actions can make a difference, individual inspectors may achieve a reasonable rate of compliance with some violators. But individual efforts, no matter how well intentioned, are by definition *not strategic*." [@betts2001, 44]

## Recommendations

Create a `RESOLUTION_CODE` for duplicates. (Already used by other cities like [Cincinnati](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Thriving-Neighborhoods/Code-Enforcement/cncm-znd6))

Do not put all information for one case on one row, overwriting old data. Instead, allow each update its own row.

Combine with assessor's database to simplify and repair location columns.

Expand categories to include information on structures and tenure.

Implement the HHRS into the data system. For occupied housing units, categorize hazards using the HHRS.
