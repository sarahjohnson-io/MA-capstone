# About {.unnumbered}

## Author --- Sarah Johnson {.unnumbered}

I completed my master's degree in City and Regional Planning from the University of Memphis in August 2021. My research interests are centered around housing quality.

I live in Memphis, Tennessee with my dog, Pepper üêï.

## Website {.unnumbered}

This website contains the final capstone that was required to complete my master's degree. It was created in RStudio using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), an R package that turns text, code, table, and pictures into a fast, simple online book. The code used to create this website is publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/sj-io/MA-capstone), along with all updates and changes.

As of September 20th, 2021 this capstone will be undergoing revisions and updates.
